<h2> Panel Discussion: Key Priorities & Challenges in a Digitally Transforming Business World </h2>

Andy Kirkland - Starbucks CISO 

2nd largest payment processor (Apple #1)

Day 0 -> Day 30 -> Day 60 -> Day 90 -> Day 180 all present different challenges, and control begins to slip away.

Being honest about the risks to the leadership is essential

Good communication lines with legal will make your life easier, you are on the same team

Pete Chronis - CTO @ CSA

Easier to invest in new, than to fix and support the old

Understand what the buisness is going through, security is a part, but knowing the entire landscape establishes common ground

The more bad stuff you find, the better. You can't fix what you don't know. 

Just because it's secure today, doesn't mean it's secure tomorrow (Read the news)

Market doesn't demand vendor products secure by default, so CyberSec must audit

Be transparent about what you're not doing, and why

Aravind Swaminathan - Co-chair of CyberSec & Privacy @ Orrick

Legacy = Juicy attack surface (Data breaches almost always hit legacy)

Low hanging fruit is the most common issue to deal with, no matter which client 

3 most common problems;

Patch management 

Insecure resources

Vuln assesment - Product team thought security was scanning, security thought it was product team's responsbility

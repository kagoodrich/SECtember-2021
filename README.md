 Notes from SECtember

<h2> Jen Easterly - Director of CISA </h2>

More connections = larger attack surface = tasty targer for APT/NSH

CISA - Cybersecurity QB, immplenet & adopt tech, research attackers, and the ways they attack

63% of top CISOs have reported a cloud data breach that included customer information

82% plan to exapand security spending

(Research new information about Solarwinds attack)

May presidental decleration of increased security - <https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/>

CISA released maturity architechtural model - <https://www.cisa.gov/publication/zero-trust-maturity-model>

CISA Cybersecurity Summit - <https://www.cisa.gov/cybersummit2021>

Trusted Internet Connections - <https://www.cisa.gov/trusted-internet-connections>

CyberSec is a team sport, no one group could do it alone.

Cyber Hygiene - <https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services>

CyberSec Awareness Month - <https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month>

Standards remove complexity, complexity is the most reliable attack surface

<h2> Panel Discussion: Key Priorities & Challenges in a Digitally Transforming Business World </h2>

Andy Kirkland - Starbucks CISO

2nd largest payment processor (Apple #1)

Day 0 -> Day 30 -> Day 60 -> Day 90 -> Day 180 all present different challenges, and control begins to slip away.

Being honest about the risks to the leadership is essential

Good communication lines with legal will make your life easier, you are on the same team

Pete Chronis - CTO @ CSA

Easier to invest in new, than to fix and support the old

Understand what the buisness is going through, security is a part, but knowing the entire landscape establishes common ground

The more bad stuff you find, the better. You can't fix what you don't know.

Just because it's secure today, doesn't mean it's secure tomorrow (Read the news)

Market doesn't demand vendor products secure by default, so CyberSec must audit

Be transparent about what you're not doing, and why

Aravind Swaminathan - Co-chair of CyberSec & Privacy @ Orrick

Legacy = Juicy attack surface (Data breaches almost always hit legacy)

Low hanging fruit is the most common issue to deal with, no matter which client

3 most common problems;

Patch management

Insecure resources

Vuln assesment - Product team thought security was scanning, security thought it was product team's responsbility

<h2> Cloud Native Security & Policy Management </h2>

Cloud Native Computing Foundation Security Advisory Group - <https://github.com/cncf/tag-security>

CNS Whitepaper - <https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/security-whitepaper/CNCF_cloud-native-security-whitepaper-Nov2020.pdf>

Kyverno - <https://kyverno.io/>

XACML - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XACML>

K8s policies are a digital contract between Dev & SecOps

<h2> Fireside Chat: Mark Russinovich </h2>

Cloud is more secure than just distributed systems

Cloud security is fundamentally an IAM issue

Mutually authenticated with TLS

Ransomware can be defeated by lifting and shifting inside the cloud assuming frequent and assured backups

Segmentation stops lateral movement once inital access has been established

The future is passwordless - <https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/15/the-passwordless-future-is-here-for-your-microsoft-account/>

OSSF - <https://openssf.org/>

We are in a golden era of CyberSec, let's look how to make it even better

<h2> Panel Discussion: Giving Zero Trusts About Cloud Security </h2>

Zero Trust - Remove inherent trust internally and externally

Lianne Caetano - Senior Director @ Lookout

ZT is a mindset that uses already established policies, while still maintaing security

Identify and prioritize your data/applications/services and monitor those

User experience should not degrade because of ZT, should improve

Shawn Harris - Director of Information Seurity @ Starbucks

ZT is a journey, you have to make continuous decisions

Ensure users can access their systems, with the absolute minimum of privleges

<https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/cloud-security/what-is-cspm-cloud-security-posture-management/>

ZT is a strategic direction

ZT starts with identity managment

Watchout for config drift

Sameer Malhotra - CEO @ TrueFort

ZT is a process that is constantly has to adjust to a changing enviroment

Get small successes, publicize them, and build into bigger wins

Do you have the info you need? Do you understand it? Continuous assesement

<h2> Trust in Security Automation â€“ The Key to Defending the Expanding Threat Landscape </h2>

Technology is changing, skills are stagnating, the gap still exists (Cloud migrations perfect example)

Do we trust our assets? (know your asset - all the time)

Security shouldn't find out about something new because of an expense report

CSAM - CyberSecurity Asset Management;

Where is my asset?

What role is it playing?

What software is it running? Is it supported? Is it authorized?

CSAM automation - Always UTD architecture, Trigger enforcement response
